# Transferring Coins

Kanari Network allows secure and transparent token transfers between accounts. This process is managed by the Move VM to ensure data integrity and security.

## Transfer Overview

A transfer involves sending a specified amount of tokens from a sender's address to a recipient's address. Each transaction is recorded on-chain with a unique hash.

## How to Transfer

To perform a transfer using the Kanari CLI, use the following command structure:

```bash
cargo run -p kanari -- transfer --to <RECIPIENT_ADDRESS> --amount <AMOUNT>
```

### Example

If you want to send **100 tokens** to the address `0x123...abc`:

```bash
cargo run -p kanari -- transfer --to 0x1234567890abcdef --amount 100
```

## Verification

After the transfer is completed, you can verify the new balances by listing the wallets:

```bash
cargo run -p kanari -- list-wallets
```

<div className="p-4 rounded-lg bg-blue-50 border border-blue-200 dark:bg-blue-900/20 dark:border-blue-800">
  <h4 className="text-blue-800 dark:text-blue-300 font-bold mb-1">Security Note</h4>
  <p className="text-sm text-blue-700 dark:text-blue-400">
    Always double-check the recipient's address before confirming the transfer. Transactions on the Kanari Network are immutable.
  </p>
</div>

## Transaction Metadata

Every transfer includes metadata that can be tracked:
- **Sender Address**: The source of the tokens.
- **Recipient Address**: The destination of the tokens.
- **Amount**: The quantity of tokens transferred.
- **Timestamp**: The exact time the transaction was recorded.
- **Transaction Hash**: A unique identifier for the transfer.

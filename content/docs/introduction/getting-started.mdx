# Quick Start

Welcome to Kanari Network. This guide will walk you through the process of building and running the Kanari CLI on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (Stable channel recommended)
- Git

## Building the CLI

To build the Kanari CLI, clone the repository and run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
cargo build -p kanari
```

## Running the CLI

Once built, you can use the CLI to interact with the network.

### List Wallets

To see the list of available wallets and their balances:

```bash
cargo run -p kanari -- list-wallets
```

> **Note:** On the first run, the CLI will perform a genesis process to initialize the local database located at `~/.kari/kanari-db/`.

### Move VM Integration

Kanari Network leverages the Move VM. You can run Move subcommands directly through the Kanari CLI:

```bash
# Create a new Move package
cargo run -p kanari -- move new <package-name>

# Run tests for a Move package
cargo run -p kanari -- move test <path-to-move-package>
```
